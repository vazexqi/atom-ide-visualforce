This contains an Atom package for working with [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) and the Visualforce Language Server.

Prerequisite

Be sure to follow the instructions at https://ide.atom.io/. In particular, ensure that you have installed the [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui) package, e.g, using `apm install atom-ide-ui`.

For reference, here are the list of plug-ins I have in my Atom installation:
